# AI Voice Assistant

This is an AI-powered voice assistant application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It uses Gemini, a large language model (LLM), to process and respond to user input through natural language.

## Features

- Voice-based interaction with users
- AI-generated responses using Gemini
- Full-stack architecture built with the MERN stack
- Modular and scalable codebase

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- LLM: Gemini API
- Other Tools: 
  - Vite (frontend bundler)
  - Nodemon (backend development server)
  - dotenv (environment variable management)

I developed this project to explore the integration of large language models into full-stack web applications. The assistant's intelligence is powered by Gemini, and the frontend/backend are built using the MERN stack.

## Notes

- `.env` files are not included for security reasons. You will need to create your own and provide necessary values such as Gemini API keys and MongoDB connection strings.
- After cloning the project, run `npm install` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories to install dependencies.
- Use `npm run dev` or equivalent scripts to start the development servers.
